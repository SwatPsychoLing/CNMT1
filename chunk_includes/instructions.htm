<p>Throughout this experiment, you will be choosing which of four images matches a given prompt.</p>
<p>Please put your browser in full screen. You must not use a touchscreen device to complete this task (a physical mouse or trackpad, as on a laptop, is fine). 
<b>You will not receive compensation for this task if you are using a touchscreen device.</b>
This task involves audio, so please make sure you are in a quiet environment; headphones are recommended. 
You will not be able to complete the task without properly functioning audio.</p>

<p><b>Instructions</b></p>
<p>
You will be shown a series of images and will be required to listen to audio instructions to choose the correct image by selecting the corresponding button. 
We are interested in how fast you are able to select the right image, so please answer as quickly as possible, while still remaining accurate. 
To speed up your answer, you should begin moving the cursor very soon once you have a hunch about which image you're supposed to select. 
However, it is important that you <b>do not begin moving the cursor until the audio begins playing</b> 
-- keep your cursor on the Go button until the audio starts and you're selecting the image.
</p>

<p>This entire task needs to be done in a single sitting, which should take about __ minutes.</p>
